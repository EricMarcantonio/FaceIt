<p>FaceIt is built mainly in <code>TypeScript</code>. It is dockerized and is ready for you try out yourself!</p>
<p>Here is a diagram about how the program is structured:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/V26yZCb/5113-C93-D-7402-4994-8-B5-A-31918-D88-F55-A.jpg"></p>
<p>It has a <code>React</code> front-end using <code>Polaris</code> as its component system. On the back-end it is running <code>NodeJS</code> and <code>ExpressJS</code>. By using the <code>face-api.js</code> package, <strong>FaceIt</strong> is able to obtain the descriptors from each face, and save them into a <code>MongoDB</code> instance (along with the image of course!).  These descriptors are then computed for an unknown face, and then compared with the DB to try and find a match.</p>
<p>The entire program is structed around Docker, with 3 components in their seperate containers: front-end, back-end and the database.</p>
