FaceIt is built in mainly `TypeScript`. It is dockerized and is ready for you try out yourself!

Here is a diagram about how the program is structured:

It has a `React` front-end using `polaris` as its component system. On the back-end it is running `NodeJs` and `ExpressJs`. By using the `face-api.js` package, FaceIt is able to obtain the descriptors from each face, and save them into a `MongoDB` instance
