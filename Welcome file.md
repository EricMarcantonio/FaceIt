It has a `React` front-end using `Polaris` as its component system. On the back-end it is running `NodeJS` and `ExpressJS`. By using the `face-api.js` package, **FaceIt** is able to obtain the descriptors from each face, and save them into a `MongoDB` instance (along with the image of course!).  These descriptors are then computed for an unknown face, and then compared with the DB to try and find a match.

The entire program is structed around Docker, with 3 components in their seperate containers: front-end, back-end and the database.
